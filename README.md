# Vision Submodule: A Real-Time 3D Computer Vision System
This submodule, part of the [EdgeCV4Safety](https://github.com/justwhiteecode/EdgeCV4Safety.git), implements an advanced computer vision system for real-time 3D perception. Using an industrial camera (via Aravis), the system performs 2D object detection and metric depth estimation to locate objects in 3D space and calculate their distance.

The architecture is designed to be **modular, high-performance, and cross-platform** thanks to the exclusive use of ONNX models, accelerated by the available hardware.

## Key Features 🌟
* **Real-Time 2D Object Detection**: Utilizes a **YOLO11** model in ONNX format for fast and accurate object identification.
* **Monocular Metric Depth Estimation**: Calculates the distance of each pixel from the camera in meters.
* **Interchangeable Depth Models**: Allows for dynamic selection between two powerful, state-of-the-art depth estimation models:
  * [**UniDepth v2**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.20110): A Vision Transformer-based model, renowned for its accuracy and its ability to infer camera parameters from the image context .
  * [**Depth Anything v2**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.09414): Another robust model, highly efficient and well-suited for indoor scenes.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Thanks to ONNX Runtime, the system is hardware-agnostic. It runs on:
  * **NVIDIA Jetson** platforms (leveraging **TensorRT** for maximum performance).
  * PCs with **NVIDIA GPUs** (leveraging **CUDA** or **TensorRT**).
  * Windows PCs with** AMD/Intel GPUs** (leveraging **DirectML**).
  * Any machine with a **CPU**, as a universal fallback.
* **Industrial Camera Integration**: Acquires video streams from GigE Vision or even USB3 Vision cameras using the [Aravis library](https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis.git).
* **UDP Data Streaming**: Sends relevant data (like the minimum distance to an object) to another node on the network via UDP sockets, to communicate to the controller node data to make decisions on.

## Files Breakdown 📂
The project is divided into clear, specialized modules:
* `run_cv.py`: The **main script** and application entry-point. It manages the main loop: frame capture, model coordination, visualization, and result data streaming.
* `detection_model.py`: Contains the `ObjectDetector` class, which encapsulates all logic for loading and running the YOLO11 ONNX model, supporting different model sizes (`"nano"`, `"small"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`, `"extra"`).
* `depth_model_depthanything.py`: Contains the `DepthEstimatorDepthAnything` class for the Depth Anything v2 model, supporting different model sizes (`"small"`, `"base"`, `"large"`).
* `depth_model_unidepth_onnx.py`: Contains the `DepthEstimatorUniDepthONNX` class for the UniDepth v2 model, supporting different model sizes (`"small"`, `"base"`, `"large"`)..
* `bbox3d_utils.py`: Provides utility functions for visualizing 3D bounding boxes and the Bird's Eye View.
* `models/`: (Recommended) A folder to store all `.onnx` model files. For GitHub restrictions, only the lighter models are available by cloning the repo. A few other models can be found on [our HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/justwhitee/EdgeCV4Safety-Models/tree/main) (not all sizes have been compiled).

## Setup and Installation 🔧
### 1. System Prerequisites
Before installing Python dependencies, ensure the [Aravis library](https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis.git) is installed on your system. 

On **Debian/Ubuntu-based** systems:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis.git
cd aravis
meson setup build
cd build
ninja
ninja install
sudo ldconfig
```
For other platforms, follow the compilation instructions from the [official Aravis website](https://aravisproject.github.io/aravis/aravis-stable/building.html).

Installation of meson and ninja dependencies (if needed):
```bash
sudo apt install libxml2-dev libglib2.0-dev cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev gobject-introspection \
                 libgtk-3-dev gtk-doc-tools  xsltproc libgstreamer1.0-dev \
                 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-dev \
                 libgirepository1.0-dev gettext
```
Installation of meson and ninja (if needed):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install meson ninja-build -y
```

### 2. Install requirements:
1) First of all, the system was created and tested with Python 3.8, but it should also work with newer versions (check compatibility of requirements among versions).

2) Install Python required libraries from the submodule directory `vision_processing/`:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3) Install ONNX runtime. This installation is critical and depends on your hardware.
    
    * For **CPU only** sysyems:
      ```bash
      pip3 install onnxruntime
      ```
      
    * For **NVIDIA GPUs** (Desktop PCs):
      ```bash
      pip3 install onnxruntime-gpu
      ```
    
    * For **NVIDIA Jetson**: Follow the official NVIDIA instructions to install the version optimized for JetPack. Some resources are available [here](https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#ONNX_Runtime).
      ```bash
      # Download pip wheel from location above for your version of JetPack
      wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/iizg3ggrtdkqawkmebbfixo7sce6j365.whl -O onnxruntime_gpu-1.16.0-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
      
      # Install pip wheel
      pip3 install onnxruntime_gpu-1.16.0-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
      ```

   _Note_: To run the application with UniDepth on TensorRT, you will need to have a recent version of TensorRT software due to operations that are not available on older versions. You need at least 8.6. For YOLO and DepthAnything, there are no relevant requirements (except `requirements.txt`).  

### 3. Model Download and Conversion
**Download** or convert the required **ONNX models** and place them in the project directory `models/`. Paths are mapped in the code in the respective class and file (`depth_model_*.py` and `detection_model.py`), particularly in the `model_map` object in the first part of the script, like: 
```python
model_map = {
            'small': './models/unidepthv2s.onnx', # you can change the file name like './models/unidepthv2_small_simplified.onnx'
            'base': './models/unidepthv2b.onnx',
            'large': './models/unidepthv2l.onnx'
        }
```
Some models are already present on [our repo](https://huggingface.co/justwhitee/EdgeCV4Safety-Models/tree/main) created for this purpose on HuggingFace.

If you want to compile by your own other sizes or even models that are not available on this repo or on HF, you can follow the following steps.

* For **YOLO**:
  1) Install requirements (with `pip3`). You can find them on [ultralytics page](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
  2) Install `ultralytics`
     ```bash
     pip3 install ultralytics
     ```
  3) Export ONNX model, where `model` must be in the form `yolo11[n|s|m|l|x]`
     ```bash
     yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx opset=12
     ```
  *Note: Sometimes in the process of compiling the ONNX version, the system will update `onnxruntime`, resulting in the loss of the GPU version (if you had it). So you have to uninstall (`pip3 uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu`) and then reinstall it from scratch following section (2.)*

* For **UniDepth v2**:
  1) Clone the [repository](https://github.com/lpiccinelli-eth/UniDepth.git)
  2) Install all the requirements. *Note that you will need at least Python 3.10 (we suggest it or 3.11 for stability), so you could get advantages by creating a virtual environment (the UniDepth repository describes how to get it).*
  3) Run the script inside the main directory of the repository
     ```bash
     python3.10 ./unidepth/models/unidepthv2/export.py --version v2 --backbone vitl --shape 462 616 --output-path unidepthv2.onnx
     ```
     *Note that camera height and width must be a multiple of 14 (the script should accommodate your values), and model sizes available are "vits", "vitb", "vitl"*. Feel free to change the `output-path`.

* For **DepthAnything v2**:
  1) Install ONNX and onnxruntime (_see [installation section](https://github.com/justwhiteecode/EdgeCV4Safety-Vision/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#2-install-requirements)_)
     ```bash
     pip3 install onnx onnxruntime
     ```
  2) Clone [this repository](https://github.com/fabio-sim/Depth-Anything-ONNX.git) for the conversion.
  3) Run the `dynamo.py` script inside the main directory of the repository. You can change the dimension (vits, vitb, vitl),
     eventually the supported image size, and the metric ambient (indoor or outdoor). _Also, relative models are available._
     Check for requirements on the official [Depth Anything v2 repository](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2.git) and for parameters on the documentation of the [conversion repository](https://github.com/fabio-sim/Depth-Anything-ONNX.git). 
     ```bash
     python3 dynamo.py export --encoder vits --metric indoor -o depth_anything_v2_metric_indoor_small.onnx
     ```

 _Extra tip_: You can try to perform some optimisations on your ONNX models using `onnx-simplifier` (you can install it with pip: `pip install onnx-simplifier`):
 ```bash
 onnxsim input_model.onnx output_model_simplified.onnx
 ```
 
*Note: You do not need to compile the ONNX model on the same machine where it will be used, as ONNX files are agnostic. 
However, to compile these files, you *have to first install all the requirements* for the specific model you are converting.*

For conversion, but maybe also for deployment purposes, it could be useful to use Docker with an appropriate image. For development and our tests with a Jetson AGX Orin, we used [dustynv/l4t-pytorch:r35.3.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/dustynv/l4t-pytorch/r35.2.1/images/sha256-431d88d9124310f8932f63bbadfaa8c88167c0035225c2df5e4392ce74d32c38)
image. You can find more images from dustynv [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/dustynv/l4t-pytorch/tags).

## Configuration and Usage 🛠️
There are a bunch of parameters that can be changed in order to achieve your goals. They are all in the first part of the main script (`run_cv.py`). 
Can be set:
* **Depth estimation model** (DepthAnything v2 or UniDepth v2) and **size** (small, base, large).
  ```python
  DEPTH_MODEL_CHOICE = "unidepth" # Depth estimation model: "unidepth", "depthanything"
  DEPTH_MODEL_SIZE = "small"  # Depth model size: "small", "base", "large"
  ```
  *Note: make sure you have the corresponding ONNX model size in the `model/` folder*
* **Object detection model size** (nano, small, medium, large, extra).
  ```python
  YOLO_MODEL_SIZE = "extra" # YOLO11 model size: "nano", "small", "medium", "large", "extra"
  ```
  *Note: make sure you have the corresponding ONNX model size in the `model/` folder*
* **Object detection parameters and class filter** by specifiyng the class id number
  ```python
  CONF_THRESHOLD = 0.75  # Confidence threshold for object detection
  IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # IoU threshold for NMS
  CLASSES = [0]  # Filter by class, e.g., [0, 1, 2] for specific CLASSES, None for all classes available
  ```
* **Birds eye and Pseudo-3D visualisation**.
  ```python
  ENABLE_BEV = False  # Enable Bird's Eye View visualization
  ENABLE_PSEUDO_3D = True  # Enable pseudo-3D visualization
  ```
* **Windows preview** of video streaming and results.
  ```python
  WINDOW_CAMERA_PREVIEW = False  # Show camera preview window
  WINDOW_RESULTS_PREVIEW = False  # Show results window
  ```
* **Camera settings and information** for Aravis and the distance calculation of another fixed point in the scene.
  ```python
  CAMERA_IP = '192.168.37.150' # None for aravis auto-choice (first found)
  CAMERA_FRAME_RATE = 22 # Check max support (pixel format dependent), i.e,. on https://www.baslerweb.com/en/tools/frame-rate-calculator/camera=a2A2448-23gcBAS
  CAMERA_PIXEL_FORMAT = Aravis.PIXEL_FORMAT_BAYER_RG_8
  CAMERA_GAIN = 30.0
  CAMERA_AUTO_EXPOSURE = True
  CAMERA_EXPOSURE_TIME = 8000
  CAMERA_BUFFER_TIMEOUT = 200000
  CAMERA_IMAGE_ROTATION_ANGLE = 0 # 0 to disable
  CAMERA_ROI_HEIGHT = 0 # 0 to disable
  CAMERA_ROI_WIDTH = 0 # 0 to disable

  CAMERA_HEIGHT_FROM_GROUND = 1.7 # Camera height from ground in meters
  CAMERA_DISTANCE_FROM_FIXED_OBJECT = 2 # Distance from a known fixed object straight to the camera in meters (used for punctual depth estimation from this object)
  ```
* **Communication node infomations**.
  ```python
  TARGET_NODE_IP = '192.168.37.50'
  TARGET_NODE_PORT = 13750
  ```

## Running the program ▶️
To run the program, you must run the **main script** from the terminal:
```bash
python3 run_cv.py
```

## Technical Details 🤓
  
### Hardware Acceleration with ONNX Runtime
  
The model classes automatically detect the available hardware and select the best **Execution Provider** (EP).
  
The priority order is: TensorRT (Jetson/NVIDIA) > CUDA (NVIDIA) > DirectML (Windows) > CPU.
  
The first run on an NVIDIA system may be slow, as TensorRT needs to build and optimize a hardware-specific engine; subsequent runs will be much faster thanks to the cache that is stored in the `trt_cache/` directory.

### Camera Parameter Handling in UniDepth

The UniDepth V2 model is capable of inferring metric depth even without explicit camera parameters by analyzing the visual context of the image. 

Our ONNX implementation provides the model with a plausible default set of intrinsics, which acts as an excellent starting point. 

The model's robust architecture then refines the estimation based on the image content, ensuring accurate results without the need for manual camera calibration.
